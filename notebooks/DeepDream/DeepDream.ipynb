Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image.\n","\n","It does so by forwarding an image through the network, then calculating the gradient of the image with respect to the activations of a particular layer. The image is then modified to increase these activations, enhancing the patterns seen by the network, and resulting in a dream-like image. This process was dubbed \"Inceptionism\" (a reference to [InceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf), and the [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception) Inception).\n","\n","Let's demonstrate how you can make a neural network \"dream\" and enhance the surreal patterns it sees in an image."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Sc5Yq_Rgxreb","cellView":"form"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title  Import Python libraries\n","\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import IPython.display as display\n","import PIL.Image    \n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append('/content/drive/My Drive/DlArt/DeepDream/')\n","\n","from utils import calc_loss, random_roll\n","from utils import DeepDream, TiledGradients"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Choose an Image from Internet or from Drive \n","#@markdown To load file from Drive, upload it first to folder 'DeepDream'\n","\n","dir = \"/content/drive/My Drive/DlArt/DeepDream/\"\n","url = \"\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","image_name = \"J.jpeg\" #@param {type: \"string\"}\n","\n","if url:\n","  name = url.split('/')[-1]\n","  img_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(name, origin=url)\n","elif image_name:\n","  img_path =  dir + image_name\n","\n","# Download an image and read it into a NumPy array.\n","def download(image_path, max_dim=None):\n","  img = PIL.Image.open(image_path)\n","  if max_dim:\n","    img.thumbnail((max_dim, max_dim))\n","  return np.array(img)\n","\n","# Normalize an image\n","def deprocess(img):\n","  img = 255*(img + 1.0)/2.0\n","  return tf.cast(img, tf.uint8)\n","\n","# Display an image\n","def show(img):\n","  display.display(PIL.Image.fromarray(np.array(img)))\n","\n","\n","# Downsizing the image makes it easier to work with.\n","original_img = download(img_path, max_dim=500)\n","show(original_img)"],"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"pKBVjks1ks3o"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"08KB502ONbGt","cellView":"form"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Load Pre-trained model\n","\n","\n","# load model\n","base_model = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Choose layers \n","\n","# Maximize the activations of these layers\n","names = [ 'mixed1'] #@param {type: \"raw\"}\n","layers = [base_model.get_layer(name).output for name in names]\n","\n","# Create the feature extraction model\n","dream_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=layers)"],"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"ywy8_NRMm96I"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Train model\n","\n","deepdream = DeepDream(dream_model)\n","get_tiled_gradients = TiledGradients(dream_model)\n","\n","# Put all together\n","def run_deep_dream_with_octaves(img, steps_per_octave=100, step_size=0.01, \n","                                octaves=range(-2,3), octave_scale=1.3):\n","  base_shape = tf.shape(img)\n","  img = tf.keras.utils.img_to_array(img)\n","  img = tf.keras.applications.inception_v3.preprocess_input(img)\n","\n","  initial_shape = img.shape[:-1]\n","  img = tf.image.resize(img, initial_shape)\n","  for octave in octaves:\n","    #
